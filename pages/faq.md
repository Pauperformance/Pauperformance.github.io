# FAQs

This page tries to give some answers to the recurring questions about this project.

<hr/>
[What is Pauperformance?](#what-is-pauperformance)

Pauperformance is a shared journey to optimal [Pauper](https://magic.wizards.com/formats/pauper), a [Magic: The Gathering format](https://magic.wizards.com/).

The project consists of two distinct yet linked parts: the **Academy** and the **Battlefield**.


<hr/>
[What is the Academy?](#what-is-the-academy)

The Academy is this website.
It aims to be the online encyclopedia for Pauper, collecting and organising resources for players with varying skill levels.

The Academy contains a growing collection of pages, mostly written by the Pauper community.
They provide information about current and old archetypes, sideboard guides, gameplay videos, meta analysis, and more.

To avoid obsolete content, large sections of the website are automatically generated and kept up-to-date by **Myr**, the Pauperformance bot.
This makes it possible for the Academy to easily follow new Magic releases and events, such as weekly online tournaments.


<hr/>
[What is the Battlefield?](#what-is-the-battlefield)

The Battlefield is where we host our shows.

Live videos are streamed on Twitch at [twitch.tv/pauperformance](https://www.twitch.tv/pauperformance); replays are archived on YouTube at [youtube.com/channel/UCDUiIskNnmuJ3XJ1SdQqs0A](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDUiIskNnmuJ3XJ1SdQqs0A).

The primary goal of the channel is to have fun together.
As a side effect, we also hope to become better Magic players.

We like to play in an unusual, cooperative way.
It allows us to discuss strategies and share ideas, while making games more engaging for the audience.
Our goal is to systematically explore the format and test different decks to offer a wide coverage of the meta.

We have a lot of fun while playing together and we hope it's going to be the same for you!


<hr/>
[Who is Myr?](#who-is-myr)

Myr is the Pauperformance bot.

It works under the hood to update the Academy and does other magic stuff.
It is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Pauperformance/pauperformance-bot).


<hr/>
[How can I support Pauperformance?](#how-can-i-support-pauperformance)

There are many ways to support the project.

The first and simplest way to support Pauperformance is to follow us/subscribe on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/pauperformance) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDUiIskNnmuJ3XJ1SdQqs0A) and to share this project with other players. This already means a lot to us.

If you are a **Pauper player** and want to help us with the development of the Academy, please join us on [Discord at #feedback](https://discord.gg/2fHG8DTA3R).
We have a [long roadmap ahead](https://trello.com/b/EtDX4rhf/roadmap) and your support is invaluable.

If you are a **content creator** (e.g. Twitch/YouTube streamer, blogger, etc.) we would be happy to link your content in the Academy and hopefully give more visibility to your work.
Creators that join the Pauperformance network and contribute to the Academy with their work are referred as **PhD** (**Pauper honourable Dignitary**).
If you are interested in getting involved in the project, please read the [phd guidelines](TODO.md) and join us on Discord at #phd.

If you are a **software developer** with a basic knowledge of Python, JavaScript, HTML, Markdown, git, and Jekyll, please [contact us](contact.html).
We haven't set up any contribution guidelines for our codebase yet, but you may still help us with some tasks in the [roadmap](https://trello.com/b/EtDX4rhf/roadmap).
We also suspect that if you have a basic knowledge of Python, JavaScript, HTML, Markdown, git, and Jekyll you will probably be already busy with your cool personal projects.
Good luck with them!

If you are a **Reddit admin of [r/pauper](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pauper/)**, please [contact us](contact.html).
We would like to further involve the Reddit community in the project.

If you wish to financially support us, please put the coins in the piggy bank.
You will probably soon be able to subscribe to Patreon for exclusive content.

Huge thanks for your help!

[What are the next steps?](#what-are-the-next-steps)

We have [tons of things to do](https://trello.com/b/EtDX4rhf/roadmap) and it's going to take a while.
We are sure it's going to be worth it: please, be patient.

Our plan is to include other people in the project.
We are specifically looking for content creators (streamers, article writers, expert players, etc.), because we wish our Academy could bring more visibility to their awesome work.
If you are a creator, there are chances you will be contacted by us in the upcoming weeks/months.
Feel free to immediately contact us if you want to know more about the project.

We plan to share updates on the status of the project on a bi-weekly basis.
Follow us for regular updates.
The journey is long, but we are highly motivated.
