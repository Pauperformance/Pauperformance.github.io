Ciao! My name is Gianvito and I'm an avid Pauper player from Italy, currently living in the Netherlands.
I once dreamed to index the Pauper content of the web to help new and experienced players enjoying this game as I do.
Pauperformance is my attempt to realize this goal and give something back to our awesome community.
